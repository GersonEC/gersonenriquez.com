It could happen that once a year, we have big expenses outside of our fixed ones. In my case, for example, it happened with my annual transport subscription.</br>
Now we can handle the fixed month expenses but how can we handle this unexpected one?
</br>
</br>
When I started budgeting, I just didn’t handle it, when the big expenses arrived, I just withdrew some extra money from the piggy bank and pay it. In the last period, I started handle it like installment way. I see what is the amount I need to pay and divide it by 12. Once I have the monthly installment I just treat it like a fixed expense and I add it to my budget process.
</br>
</br>
For example, if the annual expense is 300€, the fixed monthly amount becomes 300/12 = 25€.
</br>
</br>
This helps a lot because once we need to pay a big amount, we already set aside the amount in the previous months and it doesn’t become a headache. On the other side, this will increase our fixed expenses and it could become a problem if we don’t have the budget for it, but we can reduce the budget of some other categories and make space for this new outflow.
</br>
</br>
This is a little tip that makes a big difference to avoid feeling overwhelmed with a lot of things to pay for altogether.
