title: 'The road to learn micro-frontends'
subtitle: 'the beginning of a new journey'
date: 2024-09-22
abstract: 'Micro-frontends is not a topic you find at the beginning of your career in most of the cases, the first time I heard about it was a couple of years ago, but I never had the time to delve deeper into it and never felt the need.
This year I started using it and I started a learning path to get better into it. In this talk I will share my journey into learning Micro-frontends, what they are, what I found useful, and what I think are the most important concepts to know about it.'
